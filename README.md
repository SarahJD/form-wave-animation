# Form Wave Animation

This is a simple Login Form with a wave effect on the labels. When you click in the input, the label will wave up.
I used JavaScript for the animation and added a dynamic transition delay which gives it the wave effect.

This is the 8th project from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
